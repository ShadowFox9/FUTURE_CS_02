## Web Application Vulnerability Assessment (Task 2)

This project documents a hands-on security assessment of a deliberately vulnerable web application, conducted in alignment with the **OWASP Top 10** security risks.

The objective was to identify vulnerabilities, analyze security alerts, and document findings in a structured and professional manner similar to a real-world SOC or penetration testing engagement.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify common web application vulnerabilities
- Analyze security alerts generated during testing
- Map findings to OWASP Top 10 categories
- Document findings and remediation insights
- Practice real-world security assessment workflows

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **OWASP Juice Shop** – Vulnerable test application  
- **OWASP ZAP** – Automated and manual vulnerability scanning  
- **Burp Suite (Community Edition)** – Request interception and analysis  

---

## 📂 Project Structure


---

## 🔍 Assessment Summary
- Multiple endpoints were tested for improper authentication and authorization
- API responses were analyzed for information exposure
- Alerts were reviewed and classified based on severity and impact
- Findings were documented with supporting screenshots

---

## 📸 Evidence
All vulnerability findings are supported with screenshots captured during testing using OWASP ZAP and Burp Suite. These are located in the **screenshots/** directory.
